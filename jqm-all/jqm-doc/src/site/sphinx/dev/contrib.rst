Contributing to JQM
#############################

JQM is an Open Source project under the Apache v2 license. We welcome every contribution through GitHub pull requests.

If you wonder if you should modify something, do not hesitate to mail the maintainer at mag@enioka.com with [JQM] inside the subject. 
It also works before opening feature requests.


JQM dev environment:

* Eclipse, latest version (standard for Enioka developers, it is of course possible to successfully use other IDEs or editors)
* Maven 3.x (CLI, no Eclipse plugin) for dependencies, build, tests, packaging
* Sonar (through Maven. No public server provided, rules are :download:`here </files/rules_sonar.csv>`)
* Git

Finally, please respect our coding style and conventions: they are described in the :doc:`style` page.
