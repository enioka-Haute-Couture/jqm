Contributing to JQM
#############################

JQM is an Open Source project under the Apache v2 license. We welcome every contribution through GitHub pull requests.

If you wonder if you should modify something, do not hesitate to start a dicussion on Github.
It also works before opening feature requests.


JQM dev environment:

* Eclipse, latest version (it is of course possible to successfully use other IDEs or editors - use provided style xml)
  * Visual Studio Code configuration is also provided with the code, as it directly re-uses Eclipse formatting (and language server!).
* Maven 3.x (CLI, no Eclipse plugin) for dependencies, build, tests, packaging
* Sonar (through Maven. No public server provided, rules are :download:`here </files/rules_sonar.csv>`)
* Git

For the web application, a WebPack build is triggered by Maven during packaging of artifacts.
Developpers who want to use a hot reload configuration for the Java web app should use
the "jetty:run" goal in the WS project to start a dev server on port 8080. It uses by default (inside jetty.xml) a database that
can be created by running `jqm.sh createnode` inside the service target directory.

Finally, please respect our coding style and conventions: they are described in the :doc:`style` page.
