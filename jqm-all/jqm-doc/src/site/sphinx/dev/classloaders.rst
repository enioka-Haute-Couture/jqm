Classloading
################

JQM obeys a very simple classloading architecture, respecting the design goal of simplicity and robustness (to the expense of PermGen/Metaspace size).

The engine classloader stack is as follows (bottom of the stack is at the bottom of the table):

In the engine:

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| System class loader (JVM provided - type AppClassLoader). Used by the engine itself (except JNDI calls).                                |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Extension class loader (JVM provided - no need in JQM)                                                                                  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Bootstrap class loader (JVM provided)                                                                                                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

For payloads:

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Payload class loader (JQM provided - type PayloadClassLoader).                                                                          |
| Loads the libs of payloads from .m2 or from the payload's "lib" directory                                                               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| JNDI class loader (JQM provided - type URLClassloader)                                                                                  |
| Loads everything inside JQM_ROOT/ext                                                                                                    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Extension class loader (JVM provided - no need in JQM)                                                                                  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Bootstrap class loader (JVM provided)                                                                                                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

		
The general idea is:

* The engine uses the classic JVM-provided AppClassLoader for everything concerning its internal business
* Every payload launch has its own classloader, **totally independent from the engine classloader**. 
  This classloader is garbage collected at the end of the run.
* JNDI resources in singleton mode (see :doc:`../jobs/resources`) must be kept cached by the engine, so they cannot be loaded through 
  the transient payload classloader itself. Also, the loaded resources must be understandable by the payloads - and therefore there must be a
  shared classloader here. The JNDI classloader is therefore the parent of the payload classloaders. The JNDI classloader itself has no parent (save 
  obviously the bootstrap CL), so the payloads won't be polluted by anything foreign.  

Advantages:

* The engine is totally transparent to payloads, as the engine libraries are inside a classloader which is not accessible to payloads.
* It allows to have multiple incompatible versions of the same library running simultaneously in different payloads.
* It still allows for the exposition to the payload of an API implemented inside the engine through the use of a proxy class, a 
  pattern designed explicitly for that use case.
* Easily allows for hot swap of libs and payloads.
* Avoids having to administer complex classloader hierarchies and keeps payloads independent from one another.

Cons:

* It is costly in terms of PermGen/metaspace: if multiple payloads use the same library, it will be loaded once per payload, which is a waste of memory.
  If there are costly shared resources, they can however be put inside ext - but the same version will be used by all payloads on the engine.
* In case the payload does something stupid which prevents the garbage collection of at least one of its objects, the classloader will not be able
  to be garbage collected. This a huge memory leak (usually called a classloader leak). The best known example: registering a JDBC driver
  inside the static bootstrap-loaded DriverManager. This keeps a reference to the payload-context driver inside the bootstrap-context, and prevents
  collection. This special case is the reason why singleton mode should always be used for JDBC resources.
* There is a bug inside the Sun JVM 6: even if garbage collected, a classloader will leave behind an open file descriptor. This will effectively 
  prevent hot swap of libs on Windows.

To alleviate some of the conses, JQM also provides options to share class loaders between different job instances and reuse them between runs,
but this is at the cost of some of the pros. It is disabled by default.


All in all, this solution is not perfect (the classloader leak is a permanent threat) but has so many benefits in terms of simplicity that
it was chosen. This way, there is no need to wonder if a payload can run alongside another - the answer is always yes. There is no need
to deal with libraries - they are either in libs or in ext, and it just works. The engine is invisible - payloads can consider it as a pure JVM,
so no specific development is required.

The result is also robust, as payloads have virtually no access to the engine and can't set it off tracks.
