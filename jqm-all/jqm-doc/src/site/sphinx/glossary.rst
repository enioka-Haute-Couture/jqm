		Identified by a name called "Application Name".

	Job Request
		the action of asking politely the execution of a :term:`JobDef` (which in turn means running the payload)

	Job Instance

		end of its run (be it successful or not) into the history.

	JQM Node
	JQM Engine
		an instance of the JQM service (as in 'Windows service' or 'Unix init.d service') that can run payloads

	Job queue
	Queue
		a virtual FIFO (by default) queue where :term:`job requests<Job Request>` are lined up. These queues are polled by some :term:`nodes<JQM Node>`.

	Enqueue
		the action of putting a new :term:`Job Request` inside a :term:`Queue`. The queue is usually determined by the :term:`JobDef` which holds
		a default queue.
