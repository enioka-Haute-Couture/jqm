Docker install
*****************

JQM is available for Docker for Linux/MacOS and Docker for Windows on the Docker Hub. The image is optimized both
for development usage and for scale-out production deployment (Kubernetes, Swarm).

Full image documentation is available on the `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/r/enioka/jqm/>`_.

Binary install
***************

Windows
====================

Prerequisites:

* A directory where JQM will be installed, named JQM_ROOT afterwards
* An admin account (for installation only)
* A service account with minimal permissions: LOGON AS SERVICE + full permissions on JQM_ROOT.

The following script (PowerShell 5+) will download and copy the binaries (adapt the first two lines). Run it with admin rights. ::

    $JQM_ROOT = "C:\TEMP\jqm"
    $JQM_VERSION = "${project.version}"
    mkdir -Force $JQM_ROOT; cd $JQM_ROOT
    Invoke-RestMethod https://github.com/enioka/jqm/releases/download/jqm-all-$JQM_VERSION/jqm-$JQM_VERSION.zip -OutFile jqm.zip
    Expand-Archive ./jqm.zip . -Force
    rm jqm.zip; mv jqm*/* .

Then create a service (change user, password and desired node name)::

    ./jqm.ps1 installservice -ServiceUser marsu -ServicePassword marsu -NodeName $env:COMPUTERNAME
    ./jqm.ps1 start

And it's done, a JQM service node is now running.

.. note:: it is **really** not a good idea to run JQM, an application server with a broad attack surface, as SYSTEM or any priviledged account. Always use a service account as stated above.

Linux / Unix
====================

Prerequisites:

* A directory where JQM will be installed, named JQM_ROOT afterwards
* A group for containing the user which will actually be allowed to run jqm. Default name is jqm. (Debian-like: `sudo groupadd jqm`)
* A user account owning JQM_ROOT (not necessarily root). Default name is jqmadm. (Debian-like: `sudo useradd -m -g jqm jqmadm`)
* A user for running the engine, no specific permissions (and certainly NOT root). Inside the group above. Default name is jqm. (Debian-like: `sudo useradd -m -g jqm jqm`)

The following script will download and copy the binaries (adapt the first two lines). Run as jqmadm ::

    JQM_ROOT="/opt/jqm"
    JQM_VERSION="1.2.2"
    cd $JQM_ROOT
    wget https://github.com/enioka/jqm/releases/download/jqm-all-$JQM_VERSION/jqm-$JQM_VERSION.tar.gz
    tar xvf jqm-*.tar.gz
    rm jqm-*.tar.gz
    mv jqm-*/* .
    rmdir jqm-*
    ./bin/permissions.sh
    ./jqm.sh createnode
    ./jqm.sh start

And it's done, a JQM node is now running.

As root (optional, only if run as a service)::

    ## Ensure JQM is not running
    ln -s $JQM_ROOT/jqm.sh /etc/init.d/jqm
    chmod 700 /etc/init.d/jqm
    vi /etc/init.d/jqm
    ## Change line 5 to the value of JQM_ROOT (cd /opt/...)
    ## Purge the directory JQM_ROOT/logs
    /etc/init.d/jqm start


Testing
====================

The following will import the definition of some test jobs included in the distribution, then launch one. (no admin rights necessary nor variables).

Windows::

	./jqm.ps1 stop  ## Default database is a single file... that is locked by the engine if started
	./jqm.ps1 allxml  # This will import all the test job definitions
	./jqm.ps1 enqueue -JobDef DemoEcho
	./jqm.ps1 start

Linux / Unix::

	./jqm.sh stop  ## Default database is a single file... that is locked by the engine if started
	./jqm.sh allxml  # This will import all the test job definitions
	./jqm.sh enqueue DemoEcho
	./jqm.sh start


Check the JQM_ROOT/logs directory: two log files (stdout, stderr) should have been created (and contain no errors). Success!

Enabling the web interface
****************************

By default the web interface is disabled. This will enable it (on all network interfaces) and create a user named "root".

The server listens to a random free port shown in the main log. It can be changed later.

Windows
=========

    ./jqm.ps1 enablegui -RootPassword mypassword

Linux
=========

    ./jqm.sh enablegui mypassword


Database configuration
************************

The node created in the previous step has serious drawbacks:

* it uses an HSQLDB database with a local file that can be only used by a single process
* it cannot be used in a network as nodes communicate through the database
* General low performances and persistence issues inherent to HSQLDB

Just edit JQM_ROOT/conf/resources.xml file to reference your own database.
It contains by default sample configuration for Oracle, PostgreSQL, HSQLDB, DB2 and MySQL which are the supported databases. (HSQLDB is not supported
in production environments)

.. note:: The database is intended to be shared by all JQM nodes - you should not create a schema/database per node.

Afterwards, place your JDBC driver inside the "ext" directory.

Then stop the service.

Windows::

	./jqm.ps1 stop
	./jqm.ps1 createnode
	./jqm.ps1 start

Linux / Unix::

	./jqm.sh stop
	./jqm.sh createnode
	./jqm.sh start

Then, test again (assuming this is not HSQLDB in file mode anymore, and therefore that there is no need to stop the engine).

Windows::

	./jqm.ps1 allxml
	./jqm.ps1 enqueue -JobDef DemoEcho

Linux / Unix::

	./jqm.sh allxml
	./jqm.sh enqueue DemoEcho

Database support
====================

Oracle
------------------

Oracle 10gR2 & 11gR2 & 12c are supported. No specific configuration is required in JQM: no options inside jqm.properties (or absent file). No specific database configuration is required.

A typical schema creation would be::

    $sqlplus / as sysdba
    CREATE USER JQM IDENTIFIED BY jqm DEFAULT TABLESPACE SYSAUX QUOTA UNLIMITED ON SYSAUX ACCOUNT UNLOCK;
    GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO JQM;
    exit;

On 12c the user cannot be named JQM (must be prefixed with C##, unless `alter session set "_ORACLE_SCRIPT"=true;` is run).

PostgreSQL
------------------

PostgreSQL 9 & 10 are supported (tested with PostgreSQL 9.3). It is the recommended open source database to work with JQM.
No specific configuration is required in JQM: no options inside jqm.properties (or absent file). No specific database configuration is required.

Here's a quickstart to setup a test database. As postgres user::

    $ psql
    postgres=# create database jqm template template1;
    CREATE DATABASE
    postgres=# create user jqm with password 'jqm';
    CREATE ROLE
    postgres=# grant all privileges on database jqm to jqm;
    GRANT


MySQL
------------------

MySQL 5.6+ is supported with InnoDB (the default). No specific configuration is required in JQM: no options inside jqm.properties (or absent file).

These commands can be used to setup a database::

    $ mysql -u root -p
    mysql> create database jqm;
    mysql> grant all privileges on jqm.* to jqm@'%' identified by 'jqm';
    mysql> flush privileges;

.. note:: before version 1.4, a startup script was needed to align sequences between tables on database startup. This is no longer needed and if present, this script should be removed.

HSQLDB
------------------

HSQLDB 2.3.x is supported in test environments only.

No specific HSQLDB configuration is required. Please note that if using a file database, HSQLDB prevents multiple processes from accessing it
so it will cause issues for creating multi node environments.

.. note:: prior to version 2.0, there was a bug in a library which required specific options inside the jqm.properties file. This is no longer needed, and this file (now useless but harmless) can be removed.

Global configuration
**********************

When the first node is created inside a database, some parameters are automatically created. You may want to change them using your preferred
database editing tool or the web console. See :doc:`parameters` for this.

Many users will immediately enable the web administration console in order to easily change this configuration::

    ./jqm.sh enablegui <rootpassword>
    ./jqm.sh restart

The console is then available at http://localhost:xxxxx (where the port is a free port chosen randomly. It is written inside the main log at startup).

JNDI configuration
*******************

See :doc:`/jobs/resources`.
