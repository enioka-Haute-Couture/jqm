Using resources
###################

.. highlight:: java


Introduction
***************************************

Most programs use some sort of resource - some read files, other write to a relational database, etc.
In this document, we will refer to a "resource" as the description containing all the necessary data
to use it (a file path, a database connection string + password, ...)

There are many approaches to define these resources (directly in the code, in a configuration file...) but they all have caveats
(mostly: they are not easy to use in a multi environment context, where resource descriptions change from one environment to another).
All these approaches can be used with JQM since JQM runs all JSE code.
Yet, Java has standardized `JNDI <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Naming_and_Directory_Interface>`_ as a way to retrieve these resources, and JQM provides a limited JNDI directory implementation that can be used by
the :term:`payloads<payload>`.

JQM JNDI directory can be used for:

* JDBC connections
* JMS resources
* Files
* URLs
* Simple Strings
* Mail session (outgoing SMTP only)
* every ObjectFactory provided by the payloads

.. warning:: JNDI is actually part of JEE, not JSE, but it is so useful in the context of JQM use cases that it was implemented. The fact
	that it is present does **not** mean that JQM is a JEE container. Notably, there is no injection mechanism and JNDI resources have to be
	manually looked up.

.. note:: An object returned by a JNDI lookup (in JQM or elsewhere) is just a description. The JNDI system has not checked if the object existed, if
	all parameters are present, etc. It also means that it is the client's responsibility to open files, database connections... and **close them
	in the end**.

The JNDI system is totally independent from the JQM API described in :ref:`accessing_jqm_api`. It is always
present, whatever type your payload is and even if the jqm-api jar is not present.

By 'limited', we mean the directory only provides a single root JNDI context. Basically, all JNDI lookups are given to the
same JNDI context and are looked up inside the JQM database by name exactly as they are given (case-sensitive).

This chapter focuses on using them inside payloads. To define resources, see :doc:`/admin/resources`.

Below are some samples & details for various cases.

JDBC
*****

::

        DataSource ds = InitialContext.doLookup("jdbc/superalias");

Please note the use of InitialContext for the context lookup: as noted above, JQM only uses the root context.

It is interesting to note that the JQM NamingManager is standard - it can be used from wherever is needed, such as a JPA provider configuration:
in a persistence.xml, it is perfectly valid to use ``<non-jta-datasource>jdbc/superalias</non-jta-datasource>``.

If all programs running inside a JQM cluster always use the same database, it is possible to define a JDBC alias as the "default
connection" (cf. :doc:`../admin/parameters`). It can then be retrieved directly through the :meth:`JobManager.getDefaultConnection`
method of the JQM engine API. (this is the only JNDI-related element that requires the API).

JMS
*******

Connecting to a JMS broker to send or receive messages, such as ActiveMQ or MQSeries, requires
first a QueueConnectionFactory, then a Queue object. The implementation of these interfaces
changes with brokers, and are not provided by JQM - they must be provided with the payload or put inside the ext directory.
