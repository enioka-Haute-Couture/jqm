/**
 * Parameters for querying {@link JobInstance}s. A null parameter (the default for most QueryInterface parameters) is ignored in the query.
 * To query a null String, specify "" (empty String). To QueryInterface a null Integer, specify -1. It is not possible to QueryInterface for
 * null Calendar values, since it is far more efficient to QueryInterface by status (the different Calendar fields are only null at certain
 * statuses).<br>
 * See individual setters for the signification of QueryInterface parameters.<br>
 * <br>
 * By default, i.e. by simply using <code>JqmClientFactory.getClient().newQuery().invoke()</code>, the API retrieves the first 50 instances
 * that have ended, ordered by launch ID (i.e. by time). See {@link QueryBaseImpl#setQueryLiveInstances(boolean)} for details and how to
 * retrieve living instances in addition to ended ones.<br>
 * <br>
 *
 * Also please note that queries get more expensive with the result count, so it is <strong>strongly recommended to use pagination</strong>
 * ({@link #setFirstRow(Integer)} and {@link #setPageSize(Integer)}).
