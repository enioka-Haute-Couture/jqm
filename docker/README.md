# JQM Docker image

This is the official image for JQM (Job Queue Manager). It has Docker images available for Windows Nano 1709+ and Linux under the Apache Public License, v2.


## 1. What is JQM

JQM is an open source Java batch manager. 

It takes standard Java code (which does not need to be specifically tailored for JQM) and, when receiving an execution request, will run it asynchronously, taking care of everything that would otherwise be boilerplate code with no added value whatsoever: configuring libraries, logs, throttling processes, handling priorities between different classes of jobs, distributing the load over multiple servers, distributing the files created by the jobs, and much moreâ€¦ 

Basically, it is a very lightweight application server specifically tailored for making it easier to run Java batch jobs.

Full product description and documentation is available at [read the docs](https://jqm.readthedocs.io), code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/enioka-Haute-Couture/jqm). Maintainer (Enioka Haute Couture company) website is at http://haute-couture.enioka.com/en .


## 2. Tags

All these tags are shared, i.e. multi-architecture - each tag named "mytag" actually hides multiple platform-specific tags: mytag-windows-1709, mytag-windows-1803, mytag-linux-alpine. There should be no reason to directly use the platform-specific tags instead of the shared tags.

* latest: the highest stable release (not the most recent one, as the most recent one may be a patch on an older major version)
* nightly: a build of the master branch, with no guarantees nor support. Updated on every signifant change of the master branch.
* specific release tags: each release has its own tag with the release version like 2.1.0.
* major release tags: this tracks major (first digit) releases. Minor releases for a given major release (e.g. minor 2.2.x for major 2.x) have no breaking changes and do have an upgrade path, so this should be the default type of tag to use for most deployments.

The first release tag is 2.1.0, previous versions have no official images.


## 3. Main usage scenarios

### 3.1 Simple test run

Run: `docker run -it --rm -p 1789:1789 enioka/jqm`

A single-node, fully functional server starts after a few seconds. The web UI is available on the local machine, port 1789.

Use CTRL+C to exit. All changes made to the server are lost on exit.


### 3.2 Developer computer

In this scenario, a developer uses his preferred IDE or build tool and the resulting product of his work is automatically made available to a local JQM server.

It uses a ready to use single-node JQM install configured with sensible options for a developer: web-UI is enabled, authentication is disabled, sample jobs are ready to launch. It relies on a self-contained HSQLDB database, so it has no dependencies whatsoever.


Run: `docker run -it -p 1789:1789 -v /path/to/target/build/directory:/jqm/hotdeploy enioka/jqm`

Adapt pathes to your environments (and do not forget C:/ on Windows). The web UI is made available on the local machine, port 1789.

Configure your build system (Maven, Gradle, Ant...) to copy your job and deployment descriptor (jars and the XML) inside /path/to/target/build/directory/myjob (myjob is a name of your choosing. Do not copy files directly inside the mount directory). Files should disappear after a few seconds, and jobs should appear as ready to run inside the web UI.

Use CTRL+C to exit the node (obviously, running the node in the background then using `docker stop` also works).

> In more details...
> 
> To deploy your batch jobs, copy both the jar and the XML deployment descriptor inside the /jqm/hotdeploy mount.
> * A hotdeploy sub-directory is a `deployment unit`. It contains the deployment descriptor and the jar files referenced by this deployment descriptor.
>   * The name of this sub-directory is important, as subsequent deployments with the same name will replace each other.
>   * Only first-level sub-directories are scanned.
> * The deployment mechanism is triggered by the deployment descriptor.
>   * When copying files into a subdirectory it is therefore preferable to copy the descriptor last.
>   * To avoid using `inotify` which has cross-platform issues, the directories are simply scanned every 30s.
> * There can only be a single deployment descriptor per sub-directory. Directories with multiple XML files are ignored.
> * The jqm.jar.path inside the deployment descriptor is interpreted without its full path (JQM will use its own directory structure). The file name (base name in Unix terms) inside this path is however still very important, as there may be multiple jar files per deployment unit. This allows to reuse the "production" deployment descriptor directly.
> * All files are moved regardless of their nature, respecting existing directory structure. (such as an eventual `lib` directory with libraries, see [the packaging documentation](https://jqm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jobs/packaging.html#libraries-handling))
> * The files are removed from hotdeploy on success. (sub-directory is emptied, but not removed)
>
> This deployment mechanism is a Docker image specificity, and is **not available on non-Docker deployments**. It is also only available in single-node deployments.

> Note: in this scenario, the database is inside the container. So deleting the container deletes the database and all configuration changes with it.


### 3.3 Redistributable batch test

In this scenario, batch jobs are packaged inside a custom image. The server still uses an internal HSQLDB database. The result is a ready to run server already containing the jobs (which can in turn be triggered manually, or simply be scheduled).

The only thing needed is to copy the batch files (jar(s) and deployment descriptor(s)) inside the job repository, and import the job descriptor as in any deployment.

An example Dockerfile would be:
```
FROM enioka/jqm

# Copy jars and deployment descriptors inside the job definition repository, as in a normal deployment
COPY buildresult/* /jqm/jobs/
RUN java -jar jqm.jar -importjobdef ./jobs
```

The resulting image can then be run just as the base JQM image.


### 3.4 Single or multiple nodes production deployment

In this scenario, the goal is to have an easy to scale and deploy image with Swarm (or any orchestrator) on a production or production-like environment.

The batch jobs are directly inside a custom image. The driver required to access the external central database is inside /jqm/ext.
So the image builder just has to copy the jar and deployment descriptors inside /jqm/jobs[/subdirectory...].

An example Dockerfile would be:
```
FROM enioka/jqm

ENV JQM_POOL_DRIVER="oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver" \
    JQM_POOL_VALIDATION_QUERY="SELECT SYSDATE FROM DUAL" \
    JAVA_OPTS="-Xms1g -Xmx1g -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=128m" \
    JQM_NODE_NAME=_localhost_
    JQM_INIT_MODE=CLUSTER

COPY ojdbc4.jar /jqm/ext/
COPY buildtarget/* /jqm/jobs/
```

Note the `JQM_INIT_MODE` variable: it tells (among other things) JQM to create the node (as named by `JQM_NODE_NAME`, here the container name - \_localhost_ is a special value valid in this image) in the configuration if it does not exists, using a template (here the default one, changeable with `JQM_CREATE_NODE_TEMPLATE`). That way starting the container is enough to add the new node to the cluster. Also, database information should be provided on the command line or in a compose/K8s/... file. For example:

`docker run -p 1789:1789 --env "JQM_POOL_USER=login" --env "JQM_POOL_PASSWORD=secret" --env "JQM_POOL_CONNSTR=jdbc:oracle:thin:@//oraclehost:1521/MYINSTANCE"`

When using `JQM_INIT_MODE=CLUSTER` the database is not automatically upgraded, nor are jobs imported on startup: inside a cluster, the decision to modify the shared store structure should be manual and not the result of the deployment of a single node with a different version. To help with upgrades, a mode named `UPDATER` exists - a JQM container started in this mode will simply upgrade the database and import job definitions. It can be used in environment bootstraps and upgrades.

Also, an interesting environment variable is `JQM_CREATE_NODE_TEMPLATE`. It specifies the name of a template node (any existing node is OK as a template) to create new nodes. When the first node is created, two templates are automatically referenced, named TEMPLATE_WEB (default value - with full web interface) and TEMPLATE_DRONE (without the web interface enabled). These templates can be modified, removed, etc - and replaced with your own if required.

A sample swarm file (also working as a compose file) is provided in the JQM sources.

> For production environments, the first thing to do should be to enable security on the web services.

> Rather than building directly upon the enioka/jqm image, it can be useful to build upon the result of the "Redistributable batch test" scenario in many integration pipelines.

## 4. Image reference

* Environment variables
  * JQM_NODE_NAME: name of the node in the configuration. Default is ContainerNode. If using the internal HSQLDB database, a node named ContainerNode is already configured. If using another database, take care to add a node of this name to your configuration.
  * JQM_POOL_CONNSTR: connection string to the database. Default is an HSQLDB file database inside the container. If using another database, make sure the database driver is inside JQM_ROOT/ext (or subdirectory).
  * JQM_POOL_USER, JQM_POOL_PASSWORD: login and password for your database.
  * JQM_POOL_DRIVER: driver class name. Default is `org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver`.
  * JQM_POOL_VALIDATION_QUERY: the query to run to validate a connection is OK. Default is `SELECT 1 FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SYSTEM_USERS`.
  * JQM_POOL_MAX: the maximum number of connections the pool may contain. Default value of 10 should be OK in all cases.
  * JAVA_OPTS: parameters passed as-is to the JVM. Default is: -Xms128m -Xmx512m -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=128m
  * JQM_INIT_MODE. Governs the way JQM will initialize. Three values are possible:
    * SINGLE. The default. In this mode, JQM considers it is alone in the world. It tries to update its database schema, creates the node reference in the database (using template JQM_CREATE_NODE_TEMPLATE), imports all job definitions inside ./jobs and starts.
    * CLUSTER. In this mode, JQM considers it is running in a cluster (and therefore on an external shared database). It creates the node reference in the database (using template JQM_CREATE_NODE_TEMPLATE) and starts (no db updating). This allows easy orcherstrator scale-out: all created nodes "just work".
    * UPDATER. In this mode, JQM does not really start! It will merely update the database schema and import all job definitions inside ./jobs. This can be used in some orchestration scenarios inside bootstrap sequences. There should never be more than one updater instance running at the same time.
  * JQM_CREATE_NODE_TEMPLATE: if set to an existing node name, its characteristics (queues polled, enabled WS...) will be copied over when creating new nodes (only - existing nodes are left untouched). Mostly useful for templating new instances when using an orchestrator.
  * JQM_ROOT: the JQM installation root. It should not be changed - it exists solely to simplify some scripts.
  * JQM_HEALTHCHECK_URL: the URL used by the healthcheck. Must be modified if authentication is enabled, no need to touch it otherwise. Default is http://localhost:1789/ws/simple/localnode/health.
* Mounts
  * /jqm/ext/drivers: an empty directory inside which JDBC drivers (and actually also other shared libraries) may be placed. Mostly useful for developer-computer deployments, as in other deployment types images are created which can directly include these drivers in /jqm/ext.
  * /jqm/hotdeploy: an empty directory in which to copy your batch jobs. Same remark as above.
* Events
  * ONBUILD: none.
* Ports
  * 1789: main web service and web UI
  * 1790: JMX registry
  * 1791: JMX server
* Health check: yes, equivalent to calling the JMX bean Node.AllPollersPolling. See [the monitoring documentation](https://jqm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin/jmx.html) for more details.

## 5. FAQ

Error "Cannot create directory C:\jqm\.\hotdeploy" on node startup when running on Windows server (not client). JQM does not run as admin, and this means the default permissions on docker volume are restricted to admin on your server. Just run `icacls 'C:\ProgramData\docker\volumes\' /grant "Authenticated Users:(OI)(CI)(F)"` and `icacls 'C:\ProgramData\docker\windowsfilter\' /grant "Authenticated Users:(OI)(CI)(F)"` to allow non admin users to use volumes. Otherwise, run the container as admin with --user ContainerAdministrator (not recommended).
